# Tailwind Components Practice

This repository contains components that I build entirely with my own code,
inspired by public examples/designs from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/plus).
Inside app.html you can find inside comments a lot of mine custom implementations and the url from there they were inspired.
In this project i implemented a landing page, a price page, an about page and a not-found page from inspired from Tailwind Plus. Also i implemented a Login page and a Signup page for demo purposes.
All the components of the project are implemented responsively for all kind of screens.

## Note

- Not every link is working in this project. You can select the prices and about in the header menu to navigate to the appropiate pages.
- By clicking the login you can navigate to the login page.
- By clicking the signup you can navigate to signup page.
- In the login page when clicking the forgot password button a pop up is appeared

## Note

- This project is purely **educational** and was created for the purpose of practicing Tailwind CSS.
- It does not include any code from **Tailwind UI** (the paid product), only my custom code using Angular20, Typescript and Tailwind CSS v.3.4.17

# MyTestComponents

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.3.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
